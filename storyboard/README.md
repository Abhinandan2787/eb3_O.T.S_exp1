## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Name of the Experiment:WAP that takes two operands and one operator from the user and perform the operation and prints the result by using switch statement.

### 1. Story Outline:

C Programming Language is a very first programming language for engineering students of any streams. C programming is a general purpose, procedural programming language. This language is also known as a backbone of many other programming languages.
In this experiment a user wants to perform mathematical operations using two operands and one operator. The objective of this experiment is that a user can understand and describe basic concept of mathematical operation using switch statement.


### 2. Story:

(i) Firstly user will get the basic knowledge of C Programming and by seeing the code; they can get an idea about the experiment.<br>
(ii) There are various keywords, functions and header files are used, so user can also understand the basic tags.<br> 
(iii)  User can get an idea about the structure of C Programming.


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
(i) On the simulator screen, user can see the code of experiment and basic description of the code.<br>
(ii) There are two text boxes for input (Operands).<br>
(iii) There is a dropdown list to select the mathematical operation.<br>
(iv) There are two buttons namely Calculate and Reset, by which a user can get their result.


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
(i) By this experiment user will be able to understand and describe the basic concept of C programming.<br>
(ii) User will be able to understand the procedure of writing code.<br>
(iii) User will be able to perform mathematical operations.


#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

(i) When the user will click on the simulator, simulator screen will be open up.<br>
(ii) On screen firstly there is a code section where user can get an idea about the code and concept of C programming.<br>
(iii) There are two text boxes for input (Operands). User will give input for performing mathematical operation and a dropdown list for selecting the operation.<br>
(iv) There are buttons on screen namely Calculate and Reset, by which a user can get their result and if user wants to clear the text box section then click on reset button.


##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

(i) What do you mean by header files? What are uses of header file?<br> 
(ii) Can we run a program with using header files? Explain.<br>
(iii) Why switch () statement is used in programming?<br>
(iv ) What will happen if we are not using  getch() function?<br>
(v) Why C programming called procedural programming language?


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
(i) If the user gives the character instead of integers as an input then the simulator won't perform any operation and will ignore the given input.<br>

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
(i) User will take hardly 5 minutes to understand the procedures.<br>
(ii) It will take max. 10 minutes to complete the experiment.<br>
(iii) User will get a basic idea and procedure to make a program.


##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
â€¢	 Switch Statement:

switch (expression)<br>
{<br>
   case constant1:<br>
      // statements<br>
      break;

   case constant2:<br>
      // statements<br>
      break;

   case constant3:<br>
      // statements<br>
      break;


   case constant4:<br>
      // statements<br>
      break;


   case constant5:<br>
      // statements<br>
      break;

   default:<br>
      // default statements<br>
}

Flow chart for the experiment implementation for that takes two operand and one operator from the user and perform the operation and print the result by using switch statement.


### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png.jpeg"/><br>
Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here <br> (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intricacies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind   http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page  (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )
