C is a general purpose procedural programming language. With the help of this experiment students can understand the concept of Arithmetic operators and also apply this on other program. To perform mathematical operation, we need an input parameter (operands). User enter input and simulator will generate result.<br>
To perform addition of two numbers -> a+b.<br>
To perform subtraction of two numbers -> a-b.<br>
To perform multiplication of two numbers -> a*b.<br>
To perform division of two numbers->  a/b.<br>
To perform modules of two numbers -> a% b.
