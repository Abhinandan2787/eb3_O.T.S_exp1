### Aim
To understand the basic concept of C programming and how to perform mathematical operation using switch statement.
### Theory
C is a general purpose procedural programming language. With the help of this experiment students can understand the concept of Arithmetic operators and also apply this on other program. To perform mathematical operation, we need an input parameter (operands). User enter input and simulator will generate result.<br>
To perform addition of two numbers -> a+b.<br>
To perform subtraction of two numbers -> a-b.<br>
To perform multiplication of two numbers -> a*b.<br>
To perform division of two numbers->  a/b.<br>
To perform modules of two numbers -> a% b.

### Procedure
  Algorithm:<br>
    1.Start<br>
    2.Enter Two Numbers<br>
    3.Give choices Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Modulus<br>
    4.Enter choice<br>
    5.If choice==+<br>
     printf num1+num2<br>
     step 11<br>
     else step 6<br>
    6.If choice==-<br>
     printf num1-num2<br>
      step 11<br>
      else step 7<br>
     7.If choice==x<br>
      printf num1*num2<br>
      step 11<br>
       else step 8<br>
      8.If choice==/<br>
       printf num1/num2<br>
        step 11<br>
        else step 9<br>
      9. If choice==%<br>
        printf num1%num2<br>
        step 11<br> 
        else step 10<br>
      10.Choice is invalid<br>
      11.Stop
