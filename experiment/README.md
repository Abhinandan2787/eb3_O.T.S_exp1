### Aim
To understand the basic concept of C programming and how to perform mathematical operation using switch statement.
### Theory
C is a general purpose procedural programming language. With the help of this experiment students can understand the concept of Arithmetic operators and also apply this on other program. To perform mathematical operation, we need an input parameter (operands). User enter input and simulator will generate result.
To perform addition of two numbers  a+b
To perform subtraction of two numbers  a-b
To perform multiplication of two numbers  a*b
To perform division of two numbers  a/b
To perform modules of two numbers  a% b

### Procedure
  Algorithm:
    1.Start
    2.Enter Two Numbers
    3.Give choices Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Modulus
    4.Enter choice
    5.If choice==+
     printf num1+num2
     step 11
     else step 6
    6.If choice==-
     printf num1-num2
      step 11
      else step 7
     7.If choice==x
      printf num1*num2
      step 11
       else step 8
      8.If choice==/
       printf num1/num2
        step 11
        else step 9
      9. If choice==%
        printf num1%num2
        step 11 
        else step 10
      10.Choice is invalid
      11.Stop
