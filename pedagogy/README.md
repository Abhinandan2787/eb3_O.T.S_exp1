#### 1. Focus Area :Reinforce Theoretical Concepts <br>The user re-registers their previously learnt theoretical concepts by seeing it visually and by their working along with the experiment. They also perform the formula based experiment to acquire knowledge from it.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the concept of addition,subtraction,<br>multiplication,division & modulo of any two number | [Understand) | [Describe]
2.| User will be able to: <br>Compute the  addition, subtraction, multiplication, <br>division & modulo of any two number using switch statement | [Apply] | [Calculate]

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to:  <br>Describe the concept of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo of any two number | On the simulator screen, student  <br> writes any two number.| Write any two number to perform the experiment
2.| User will be able to: <br>Compute the  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo of any two number using switch statement | On the simulator screen, student <br> can select any one operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo and gets the answer after performing any one operation using switch statement.  |Compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and  modulo of two operands.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student click on the  <br>simulation tab | Simulator screen of the  <br>experiment will open  | To open the screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will write  <br>any two number | On simulator’s screen two number <br> will show  | A two number has given as an input
3.| Student will click on <br> the any one button from ‘ADD’, ‘SUB’, ‘MUL’, ‘DIV’ and ‘MOD’ | On simulator’s screen a message has<br> show after performing any one operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.|Perform any one operation using two operands
