#### 1. Focus Area :Reinforce Theoretical Concepts <br>The user re-registers their previously learnt theoretical concepts by seeing it visually and by their working along with the experiment. They also perform the formula based experiment to acquire knowledge from it.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Learn the concept of different mathematical operations like addition,subtraction,<br>multiplication,division & modulo of any two number | [Understand) | [Describe]
2.| User will be able to: <br>perform mathematical operation i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, <br>division & modulo on given data | [Apply] | [Calculate]
3.| User will be able to: <br>Write a program to perform mathematical operation i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo  on given data | [Apply] | [Calculate]

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to:  <br>Learn the concept of different mathematical operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo of any two number | On the simulator screen, student  <br> will give any two number as an input.| give any two number as an input to perform the experiment
2.| User will be able to: <br>perform mathematical operation i.e. the  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo on given data | On the simulator screen, student <br>can select any one operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.   |perform one of the operation from  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and  modulo of two operands. 
3.| User will be able to: <br>Write a program to perform mathematical operation i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulo  on given data | On the simulator screen,  <br>after selection of operation press on ‘Calculate’ button & get the result.  |After performing one of the operations we can get result.

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student click on the  <br>simulation tab | Simulator screen of the  <br>experiment will open  | To open the screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will give any <br>two number as an input |simulator take two number as an input|Give two number as an input to perform mathematical operations
3.| Student will click on <br>drop down button and select any one operation from ‘ADD’ (+), ‘SUB’ (-), ‘MUL’ (*), ‘DIV’ (/) and ‘MOD’ (%) | simulator takes two <br> number & perform any one mathematical operation.|To Perform different mathematical operations.
4.| After selection of operation  <br>student will press “Calculate’ button. |Calculate the final value according to the operation select.
